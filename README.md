# Match_pred_Analysis
This project uses machine learning to predict English Premier League (EPL) football match winners. We scrape and clean match data, then build predictive models with scikit-learn. By training on historical data and refining our approach iteratively, we aim to develop a reliable tool for forecasting match outcomes, benefiting fans and analysts.
